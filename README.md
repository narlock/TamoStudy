**TamoStudy** is a work and study timer designed to enhance productivity, incorporating an enjoyable virtual pet to motivate users to concentrate on their tasks. Programmed utilizing **Java 8**, development for this application began in January of 2021.

## üöÄ **Features**

### üëã **Welcome Screen**

An improved program launcher. Allows the user to select either local study and the soon-to-be-developed online study.

### ‚è∞ **Focus Timers**

Simple, customizable countdown timers for deep focus work.

![Focus Timer](./README%20Assets/FocusTime.png)
- *Custom Interval Countdown*: Customize the number of minutes and the number of a seconds in a single focus session.
- *5-Interval Countdown*: Easily choose a focus time from a selection of factors of 5 minutes.
- *Pomodoro*: The popular *[pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)* that breaks work into intervals. For a number of sessions, focus for a specified amount of time, then take a break for a specified amount of time.

![Stopwatch]()
- *Stopwatch*: A standard stopwatch timer which counts up. The implementation in TamoStudy counts the amount of cycles (100 minutes) studied. The timer will appear back to 0 minutes and 0 seconds after each cycle.

Upon completing focus sessions, you will receive Tamo Tokens! With Tamo Tokens, you can purchase food for your virtual pet and additional customization! To keep your Tamo happy, you must complete your desired focus sessions!

### üõçÔ∏è **Shop**

A shop for purchasing food to feed the user's virtual pet. Additionally, the user can purchase cosmetic customization items!

- Beside the Tamo Token lies the price of the specified item. Adjacent to the price for food is the amount of food points the selected food item will give the virtual pet.
- Purchasing a food item will automatically satisfy the hunger of the user's virtual pet.
- Purchasing a background will add the background to the user's inventory.

### üåá **Inventory**

The user's inventory allows for items to be stored and used when the user desires. As of TamoStudy Beta v4.2, the inventory supports backgrounds. The user can utilize the "Select" button next to the background of their choice to apply the background to their Tamo!

      - Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
      - macOS (Monterary, Ventura)

2. Java Runtime Environment

    TamoStudy was developed utilizing the Java programming language. An installation of the Java Runtime Environment is required to run Java applications. TamoStudy runs on Java 8. A download for Java can be found [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

3. Downloading TamoStudy

    - For Linux distributions, permissions to execute the application must be granted.
    - For macOS, depending on the installation, the user may need to launch the application through the command line (assuming the application already has permissions). To run through the command line, navigate the terminal to the directory of TamoStudy, then type the command `java -jar TamoStudy.jar`. The application will now function properly.

## Original Concept Idea

I wanted a way to record the amount of time I spent focused every day. At the time, I was cleaning through my room and found my Tamagotchi that I used to play with when I was very young. I thought that implementing a Tamagotchi-like pet into a focus timer would be a good idea. The more I focus and get my work done, the more upgrades and new things I can do with the virtual pet (in my project, it's called a Tamo).

Project plans to include a GUI in which a user can create a username and password along with give a name for their Tamo. The user can re-load this information so they can load where they left off in their studies. (Keeping the total amount of time they have focused, and their previous Tamo alive)

The Focus GUI will have a set timer (minutes and seconds) the user can choose. When the user begins the Focus session, the timer will count down (this is the time where the user will work). After the timer is up, the session will be completed, and the Tamo will gain experience and happiness, and the user will gain money.
